An Arduino MEGA 2560 is the basis for this project.
The length of the code, the amount of RAM, and the number of I/O pins required for this project only allows an Arduino MEGA 2560 to be used.

A schematic diagram is not yet available.

Only commonly available breakout boards and loose parts are used. No SMD's are used.

Parts required are:
- 1 x 4-channel 16bit ADC breakout board
- 2 x INA219 breakout boards, the shunt resistor has to be removed
- 2 x external high power shunt resistors
- 1 x 300 Amp bistable relais
- 1 x 1602 display unit with I2C interface
- 4 x 1:3 resistor dividers for voltage sensor probes
- 2 x push buttons
- 2 x LED's (with resistor)
- 3 x Logic level FET's to control FAN and relais coils
- 1 x temperature sensor per Lithium Cell, plus one sensor for ambient temperature and one for outside temperature.
- 1 x Ethernet board
- 1 x 5 Volt switching power supply
- 1 x 3.3 Volt switching power supply (for ethernet board) with logic enable input
