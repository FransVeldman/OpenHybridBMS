# Schematic diagram
Sorry, there is no schematic diagram yet. It is probably going to take a while before I have time to spend to fiddle with the gEDA design software to draw what I already built. But if someone who is proficient with design software wants to help out to draw a gEDA compatible schematic, that would be awesome!

## In the mean time
The amount of external parts is limited, the I/O pin numbers to interface with them are listed in the source code, so it should not be too difficult to put it together by reading and understanding the source code.<br>
If you have trouble controlling a relay from an Arduino without a schematic, or connecting a few buttons, a display and a bunch of I2C boards, then probably you shouldn't try to build this project.<br>
Working with powerful Lithium cells which can easily deliver 1000Amp's or more can be very dangerous and requires a certain level of competence with electronics. You need to be able to understand what you are doing and to double check everything, and not just relying on someone else's schematic diagram. Any mistake can result in serious damage and/or injury.
